# OLTP Playground 

## What dis?

Really not sure what the end goal of this repository is but, the general idea to start with is to be able to provide a scalable REST interface to play around with different data sources (OLTP) in a simple stupid way, making data engineering a bit tidy and simple.

But the real goal is to learn a few things on how to design such systems, the minute details that go in on them like the choice of tools, or even linting , maintaining code quality, TDD, .etc would be a crucial experience.
